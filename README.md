# Description
My dad loves to take photos and make time-lapses. However all the free time-lapse software he found online require purchase to create high-resolution videos. So why not make him one myself?

# How to use
1. Download the pre-build executable found at [dist](dist/) directory.

2. Clone the repo and run it using Python 3
    - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - Run using: `python TimeLapse.py`
